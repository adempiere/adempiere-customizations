# ADempiere Customizations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is part of the [ADempiere UI Gateway](https://github.com/adempiere/adempiere-ui-gateway) stack —
> a set of cooperating services that together provide the ADempiere web and gRPC frontend.
> The migration of all stack repositories from the [Systemhaus-Westfalia](https://github.com/Systemhaus-Westfalia)
> organization to the [ADempiere](https://github.com/adempiere) organization is currently in progress.
> Until the complete stack has been migrated and validated end-to-end, this repository should be considered
> **under construction**. Interfaces and configuration may change without notice.
> Production use is not yet recommended.

## How to add Java customizations (`base/src/`)

Add your Java source files under `base/src/main/java/`.
Use standard ADempiere package names — the module name `base` is a Gradle build identifier
only and does not affect Java package or class naming.

---

## How to add organization-specific library dependencies (`patches/`)

Declare your organization's proprietary or localization libraries in `patches/build.gradle`
under the `dependencies` block. A commented example is provided there.

---

## How to add a patch module

For larger or logically separate patches, add a dedicated module.
Example: adding a patch for `org.spin.loan_management`.

`settings.gradle` already includes loan management as an example:
```gradle
include (':' + rootProject.name + '.investment-and-loan')
project (':' + rootProject.name + '.investment-and-loan').projectDir = file('investment-and-loan')
```

Steps:
- Add a subfolder named `investment-and-loan`
- Add `api project(':adempiere-customizations.investment-and-loan')` in the root `build.gradle`
  below `api project(':adempiere-customizations.base')`
- Inside the folder add a `build.gradle` modelled on `base/build.gradle`
- Change `def packageName = "base"` to `def packageName = "investment-and-loan"`
- Add a `src/main/java` folder and place your patch classes there

---

## Local build setup

Add to `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```properties
deployUsername=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
deployToken=YOUR_GITHUB_PAT_WITH_READ_PACKAGES_SCOPE
```

Build:
```bash
gradle clean build
```

## Repository secrets

### General
- `DEPLOY_PUBLISH_GROUP`: Group to publish. Default: `io.github.adempiere`.

### GitHub Packages (required for all)

Required whether you use this repo as-is or as a fork.

- `DEPLOY_PUBLISH_GITHUB_URL`: Publish URL. Default: `https://maven.pkg.github.com/adempiere/adempiere-customizations`.
  Change this to your own org/repo if you are publishing from a fork.
- `DEPLOY_REPOSITORY`: Maven repository URL for downloading packages. Default: `https://maven.pkg.github.com/adempiere/adempiere-customizations`.
- `DEPLOY_USER`: GitHub username with write access to the package repository.
- `DEPLOY_TOKEN`: GitHub classic PAT with `write:packages` scope for the above user.

### Maven Central / Sonatype (adempiere org only)

The adempiere org publishes releases to Maven Central under the group `io.github.adempiere`.
This is the standard publication policy for this repository.
Implementors publishing from a fork do **not** need these secrets — GitHub Packages is sufficient.

- `DEPLOY_PUBLISH_SONATYPE_URL`: Sonatype staging URL. Default: `https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2/`.
- `PGP_PASSPHRASE`: Passphrase for the GPG signing key.
- `PGP_SECRET`: GPG private key (base64-encoded).
- `OSSRH_USERNAME`: Sonatype username.
- `OSSRH_TOKEN`: Sonatype token.
